        Validate newsfragment files:
        1. Read valid types from [tool.towncrier.fragment] in towncrier.toml
        2. Filename must follow the pattern: [number].[type].rst OR +[hash].[type].rst where:
           - [number] is an issue number or PR number
           - [type] must be one of the types defined in towncrier configuration
        3. Content must be a clear, concise description of the change
        4. Content should be suitable for inclusion in CHANGES.rst
        5. Verify the type matches the nature of the change based on towncrier type definitions
        6. Flag any files with invalid types or malformed filenames
        7. Check that the description is meaningful (not just "fix" or "update")

        instructions: |
          Check if a newsfragment file has been added to the newsfragments/ directory.
          Read the towncrier configuration from towncrier.toml to determine valid newsfragment types.
          If no newsfragment is present, suggest which type should be added based on the PR changes.
          Suggest the filename format: [issue_or_pr_number].[type].rst (or +[hash].[type].rst for orphan fragments)
          Remind contributors to use: `pipenv run towncrier create [number].[type].rst`
          Skip the check if the PR only updates existing newsfragments or is a trivial change.
